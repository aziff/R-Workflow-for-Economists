# R Workflow for Economists

I prepared these notes to help organize the basics needed to use R alongside workflow tools such as Git. I adapted many of the examples from other sources. Please refer to the bibliography of each chapter for attribution of the exercises. Please [email me](mailto:anna.ziff@duke.edu) if you encounter errors. All errors are my own.
